# Text-Completion-Using-Fine-Tuning-LLMs
Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) involves adapting a pre-trained model to perform well on a specific task or to reflect a specialized domain of language. Fine-tuning is essential when the model’s general knowledge needs refinement to meet the precision required in a specific field or task.
# Introduction
Fine-tuning is the process of taking a pre-trained model and further training it on a specialized dataset to adapt it for a specific task. In traditional Machine Learning, training typically starts from scratch with a model initialized with random parameters. The model gradually learns by updating these parameters to minimize errors on the dataset. However, fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) begins with a model that has already learned general language patterns from extensive pre-training on vast, diverse datasets. This gives the model a foundational understanding of language that can be tailored by fine-tuning on a smaller, more focused dataset to capture domain-specific nuances. Fine-tuning is ideal when we need a model to perform well in a particular field or when you need the model to generate text that aligns closely with specialized terminology or style (e.g., legal or medical text). Conversely, using LLMs directly without fine-tuning is effective when a task is broad, has a general purpose, or benefits from the diversity of the original pre-training data, such as casual conversation, creative writing, or answering general knowledge questions. Fine-tuning requires additional time and resources, so it’s best reserved for tasks where the model’s performance noticeably improves by specializing in a specific domain. The TrainingArguments class is used to define the hyperparameters and settings for training. Key parameters include:
1. output_dir: Directory to save model checkpoints.
2. evaluation_strategy= “epoch”: Evaluate the model at the end of each epoch.
3. per_device_train_batch_size and per_device_eval_batch_size: Number of samples processed per device in each batch during training and evaluation, respectively.
4. num_train_epochs=1: Train the model for a single epoch.
5. logging_steps: How often to log training information.
6. save_total_limit=1: Limits the saved checkpoints to avoid storage overload.

# Features
IMDB dataset. Distilgpt model

# Conclusion
In this final section, we provide a sample prompt (“The script”) to test the model’s generative capabilities. The generate() function creates a new text sequence by sampling from the model’s learned distribution. By decoding and printing the output, you can observe how well the fine-tuned model generates text that aligns with the IMDb dataset. Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) means adapting a pre-trained model to perform well on a specific task or to reflect a specialized domain of language. Fine-tuning is essential when the model’s general knowledge needs refinement to meet the precision required in a specific field or task.
